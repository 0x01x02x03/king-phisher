Server Plugins
==============

Server plugins need to inherit from the
:py:class:`~king_phisher.server.plugins.ServerPlugin` class which provides the
basic outline. Server plugins have access to their respective configurations
from the :py:attr:`~king_phisher.server.plugins.ServerPlugin.config` attribute.
This configuration can be changed at runtime, but changes will not be kept after
the server has stopped. A plugin that needs to store data persistently can use
the :py:attr:`~king_phisher.server.plugins.ServerPlugin.storage` attribute which
acts a simple key value store and is backed by the database. Values stored in
this must be able to be serialized making it impossible to directly store custom
objects.

Server plugins can hook functionality by utilizing the :py:mod:`~server.signals`
module. This allows plugins to provide functionality for specific events.

Example
-------

The following is a commented example of a basic "Hello World" plugin.

.. code-block:: python

   import king_phisher.plugins as plugin_opts
   import king_phisher.server.plugins as plugins
   import king_phisher.server.signals as signals

   # this is the main plugin class, it is necessary to inherit from plugins.ServerPlugin
   class Plugin(plugins.ServerPlugin):
       authors = ['Spencer McIntyre']  # the plugins author
       title = 'Hello World!'
       description = """
       A 'hello world' plugin to serve as a basic template and demonstration.
       """
       homepage = 'https://github.com/securestate/king-phisher-plugins'
       options = [  # specify options which need to be set through the configuration file
           plugin_opts.OptionString(
               'name',               # the options name
               'the name to greet',  # a basic description of the option
               default=None          # a default value can be specified to
           )
       ]
       req_min_version = '1.4.0'     # (optional) specify the required minimum version of king phisher
       version = '1.0'               # (optional) specify this plugin's version
       def initialize(self):
           self.logger.warning('hello ' + self.config['name'] + '!')
           # connect to a signal via it's object in the signals module
           signals.server_initialized.connect(self.on_server_initialized)
           return True

       def on_server_initialized(self, server):
           self.logger.warning('the server has been initialized')
